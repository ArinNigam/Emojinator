## üìã What Does Emojinator Do?

- Provides fun facts about emojis through an interactive and expanding section.
  
## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

### **1. Streamlit:**
Streamlit is a fast and easy-to-use framework for building web applications. We use it to create the UI and handle user interaction for the Emojinator chatbot.

- **Why Streamlit?**
  - Quick to build interactive applications
  - Allows the integration of machine learning models seamlessly
  
### **2. Mistral API:**
We use the Mistral API, a lightweight API for interacting with powerful language models. It's responsible for generating the witty responses and suggesting emojis based on user inputs.

- **Why Mistral?**
  - Great performance and faster responses.
  - Allows the flexibility of using pre-trained language models without complex setup.
  
### **3. Python:**
This project is entirely built using Python. We use Python for:
  - Sending requests to the Mistral API.
  - Managing the chatbot logic and emoji suggestion.

### **4. Custom CSS (Optional):**
While Streamlit doesn't natively support extensive styling, we inject custom CSS to improve the look and feel of the app. Contributors can help by customizing the UI further with CSS.
